# FXdatascraping
The FX data scraping was done using CAD as a base currency and forign currencies are measured against the CAD. 

Installation: 

This was a python project and Python 2.7 was used to build this. I used a JSON API which can be accessed by visiting fixer.io


Contributing: 

Fork it and expand on this project by using different currency options as the base currency (other than CAD). Four major currencies were used to perform this scraping but other currencies can be added for the scraping purposes.
